For aspects like designing the batteries, catalysts or drugs of tomorrow DFT is nowadays a key building block of the ongoing research. The aim to tackle even larger and more involved systems with DFT, however, keeps posing novel challenges with respect to physical models, reliability and performance. For tackling these aspects in the multidisciplinary context of DFT we recently started the <a href="https://dftk.org">density functional toolkit &#40;DFTK&#41;</a>, a DFT package written in pure Julia.</p> <p>Employing GPUs to bring speed improvements to DFT simulations is an established idea. However, in state-of-the-art DFT simulation packages the GPU version of the solution algorithm is usually implemented in a separate code base. In other words the CPU and the GPU version co-exist, which has the drawback of the duplicated effort to fix bugs or for keeping both code bases in sync whenever a novel method or algorithm becomes available. Since conventional GPU programming frameworks feature a steep learning curve for newcomers, oftentimes the GPU version is lagging behind and features an increased code complexity making the investigation of novel GPU algorithms challenging.</p> <p>In this project we want to build on the extensive GPU programming capabilities of the Julia ecosystem to enable DFTK to offload computations to a local GPU. Key aim will be to minimise the code which needs to be adapted from the present CPU code base in DFTK to achieve this. Since GPU counterparts already exist for most computational bottlenecks of a DFT computation, the key challenge of this project will be to handle the overall orchestration of the computational workflow as well as the data transfer between the CPU and the GPU. To keep the task manageable we will not directly tackle the full DFT problem &#40;a non-linear eigenvalue problem&#41;, but restrict ourselves to the reduced setting of linear eigenvalue problems. Expanding from there towards the full DFT is an optional stretch goal of the project.</p> <p><strong>Level of difficulty:</strong> Medium to difficult</p> <p><strong>Project size:</strong> large, i.e. 12 weeks a 30 hours</p> <p><strong>Recommended skills:</strong> Interest to work on an multidisciplinary project bordering physics, mathematics and computer science with a good working knowledge of numerical linear algebra and Julia. Detailed knowledge in the physical background &#40;electrostatics, material science&#41; or about GPU programming is not required, but be prepared to take a closer look at these domains during the project.</p> <p><strong>Expected results:</strong> Use Julias GPU programming ecosystem to implement an algorithm for solving the type of eigenvalue problems arising in density-functional theory.</p> <p><strong>Mentors:</strong> Valentin Churavy, Michael F.

While creating an animation in Javis, there is much room for performance improvements such as in the area of creating Objects and Actions, managing the data structures for Objects and Actions, rendering an animation, and handling different media formats &#40;such as gif and mp4&#41;. For this specific project, a contributor will work with Ole and Arsh to create a profiling scheme for Javis to identify performance bottlenecks and measure allocations, determine caching and memory flexible modes of rendering animations with tools such as <a href="https://github.com/JuliaIO/FFMPEG.jl">FFMPEG.jl</a>, and finish implementing live streaming of animations. The goal for this project will not be to fully fix all identified performance issues but rather to identify and catalogue them for further development by Javis maintainers and contributors.</p> <h2 id=building_novel_animation_abilities_for_javis ><a href="#building_novel_animation_abilities_for_javis">Building Novel Animation Abilities for Javis</a></h2> <p><strong>Mentors:</strong> Jacob Zelko, Giovanni Puccetti</p> <p><strong>Recommended Skills:</strong> General understanding of Luxor and the underlying structure of Javis</p> <p><strong>Duration:</strong> 175 hrs</p> <p><strong>Difficulty:</strong> Medium</p> <p>Javis&#39;s interface has matured to a great point - but we believe Javis can do even more&#33; Although Javis can do complex transformations such as morphing one polygon to another, Javis is capable of more than that. In this project, a contributor will work with Jacob and Giovanni to create new animation abilities for Javis to handle different coordinate systems, developing new types of shorthand expressions for object creation known as JObjects, further developing morphing, building out the flexibility of layers, and developing new interfaces &#40;see this <a href="https://github.com/JuliaAnimators/Javis.jl/pull/434">PR for an idea</a>&#41;.

This format is already digitilized, and packages such as MIDI.jl and MusicManipulations.jl allow for seamless data processing. But arguably the most interesting kind of music to analyze is the live one. Live music performances are recorded in wave formats.

The method exploits the factorization structure to sample <em>a single</em> continuous time Markov chain targeting a joint distribution in parallel. In contrast to parallel Gibbs sampling in the method at no time a subset of coordinates is kept fixed. In Gibbs sampling keeping a subset fixed is the main device to achieve massive parallelism: given a separating set of coordinates, the conditional posterior factorizes into independent subproblems. In the presented method, a particle representing a parameter vector sampled from the posterior never ceases to move, and it is only the decisions about changes of the direction of the movement which happen in parallel on subsets of coordinates.</p> <p>There are already two implementations available which make use of Julias multithreading capabilities. Starting from that, the contributor implements a version of the algorithm using GPU computing techniques as the methods is are suitable for these approaches.</p> <p><strong>Expected Results</strong>: Implement massive parallel factorized bouncy particle sampler &#91;1,2&#93; using GPU computing.</p> <p><strong>Recommended Skills</strong>: GPU computing, Markov processes, Bayesian inference.</p> <p><strong>Mentors</strong>: <a href="https://github.com/mschauer">Moritz Schauer</a></p> <p><strong>Rating</strong>: Hard, 350 hours</p> <p>&#91;1&#93; Moritz Schauer: ZigZagBoomerang.jl - parallel inference and variable selection.

Ideally, we hope that Pluto will make scientific computing more accessible and fun for everyone, especially beginner students and programmers who might not have used a terminal before&#33;</p> <p>For this reason, we want Pluto to be a standalone <a href="https://www.electronjs.org/">Electron</a> app, just like VS Code, Slack, WhatsApp, GitHub Desktop, Atom, and many others. Pluto as a standalone app opens the door to a more smooth and uniform user experience across the board, through Electron&#39;s native file system capabilities, setting the app to open notebook files when double-clicked, and configurable automated updates for both Pluto and Julia.</p> <p>This project can be broken down into four smaller chunks.</p> <ol> <li><p>Serve Pluto&#39;s web files in Electron</p> <li><p>Get the Electron view talking with a local Pluto server</p> <li><p>Implement native file system features for Pluto in Electron</p> <li><p>Package the app into an easily installable binary &#40;exe for Windows, dmg for MacOS, etc.&#41;, with the Julia executable embedded.</p> </ol> <p><strong>Expected Results:</strong> An Electron app for editing Pluto.jl notebooks, with support for operating system-specific features like file open or double-click. </p> <p><strong>Required skills:</strong> JavaScript, NodeJS.</p> <p><strong>Duration:</strong> 175 h</p> <p><strong>Difficulty:</strong> Easy</p> <p><strong>Mentors:</strong> <a href="https://github.com/ctrekker">Connor Burns</a>, <a href="https://github.com/dralletje">Michiel Dral</a>, <a href="https://github.com/fonsp">Fons van der Plas</a> and fellow Pluto.jl maintainers</p> <h2 id=wrapping_a_rust_http_server_in_julia ><a href="#wrapping_a_rust_http_server_in_julia">Wrapping a Rust HTTP server in Julia</a></h2> <h3 id=introduction ><a href="#introduction">Introduction</a></h3> <p>Context: <em>Pluto is a notebook system written in Julia, which means that it runs an HTTP/WS web server in Julia. We currently use the <a href="https://github.com/JuliaWeb/HTTP.jl">HTTP.jl</a> for this, an ambitious project to write an HTTP server and client in pure Julia. While HTTP.jl works well in most scenarios, we still find that Pluto&#39;s connection is not always reliable. This is because people use Pluto on such a wide range of systems, with all kinds of network configurations, proxies, firewalls, browser interactions etc.</em> </p> <p>Looking for alternatives, we believe that, instead of using a pure-Julia implementation of HTTP, we should wrap around an existing, high-production web server like <a href="http://hyper.rs/">hyper.rs</a>. Julia has a rich history of wrapping libraries written in C, C&#43;&#43;, Python, Go, JS and more, and the package manager has first-class support for external binaries.</p> <h3 id=details ><a href="#details">Details</a></h3> <p>As a participant of this project, you will build on top of the Julia and Rust ecosystems.

The term is a contraction of &quot;now&quot; and &quot;forecasting&quot; and originates in meteorology. </p> <p>The objective of this project is to introduce scalable regression-based nowcasting and forecasting methodologies that demonstrated the empirical success in data-rich environment recently. Examples of existing popular packages for regression-based nowcasting on other platforms include the &quot;MIDAS Matlab Toolbox&quot;, as well as the &#39;midasr&#39; and &#39;midasml&#39; packages in R. The starting point for this project is porting the &#39;midasml&#39; package from R to Julia. Currently Pythia has the sparse-group LASSO regression functionality for forecasting. </p> <p>The following functions are of interest: in-sample and out-of sample forecasts/nowcasts, regularized MIDAS with Legendre polynomials, visualization of nowcasts, AIC/BIC and time series cross-validation tuning, forecast evaluation, pooled and fixed effects panel data regressions for forecasting and nowcasting, HAC-based inference for sparse-group LASSO, high-dimensional Granger causality tests.

As such, they do not provide the computational advantage expected of universal quantum computers. Nonetheless, they are extremely important, as they underpin most techniques for quantum error correction and quantum networking. Software that efficiently simulates such circuits, at the scale of thousands or more qubits, is essential to the design of quantum hardware. The <a href="https://github.com/Krastanov/QuantumClifford.jl">QuantumClifford.jl</a> Julia project enables such simulations.</p> <h2 id=gpu_accelerated_simulator_of_clifford_circuits ><a href="#gpu_accelerated_simulator_of_clifford_circuits">GPU accelerated simulator of Clifford Circuits.</a></h2> <p>Simulation of Clifford circuits involves significant amounts of linear algebra with boolean matrices. This enables the use of many standard computation accelerators like GPUs, as long as these accelerators support bit-wise operations. The main complications is that the elements of the matrices under consideration are usually packed in order to increase performance and lower memory usage, i.e. a vector of 64 elements would be stored as a single 64 bit integer instead of as an array of 64 bools. A Summer of Code project could consist of implement the aforementioned linear algebra operations in GPU kernels, and then seamlessly integrating them in the rest of the QuantumClifford library. At a minimum that would include <a href="https://github.com/Krastanov/QuantumClifford.jl/blob/v0.4.0/src/QuantumClifford.jl#L725">Pauli-Pauli products</a> and certain <a href="https://github.com/Krastanov/QuantumClifford.jl/blob/v0.4.0/src/symbolic_cliffords.jl">small Clifford operators</a>, but could extend to general <a href="https://github.com/Krastanov/QuantumClifford.jl/blob/v0.4.0/src/QuantumClifford.jl#L1385">stabilizer tableau multiplication</a> and even <a href="https://github.com/Krastanov/QuantumClifford.jl/blob/v0.4.0/src/QuantumClifford.jl#L985">tableau diagonalization</a>. </p> <p><strong>Recommended skills:</strong> Basic knowledge of the <a href="https://krastanov.github.io/QuantumClifford.jl/dev/references/">stabilizer formalism</a> used for simulating Clifford circuits.

This is useful, for instance, when studying the performance of error-correcting codes. In such simulations it is possible to run one single relatively expensive simulation of the noise-less circuit in order to get a reference and then run a large number of much faster &quot;Pauli Frame&quot; simulations that include the random noise. By utilizing the reference simulation, the random noise simulations could more efficiently provide samples of the performance of the circuit under noise. This project would involve creating an API for such simulations in QuantumClifford.jl.

This form is called a Stabilizer tableaux. This project would involve creating a comprehensive library of frequently used quantum error correcting codes. As an initial step that would involve implementing the tableaux corresponding to simple pedagogical codes like the Steane and Shor codes, toric and surface codes, some CSS codes, etc. The project can be extended to a much longer one by including work on decoders for some of these codes.

However, applying a single-qubit or two-qubit gate to an n-qubit tableaux is much faster as it needs to address only one or two columns of the tableaux. This project would focus on extending the left-multiplication special cases already started in <a href="https://github.com/Krastanov/QuantumClifford.jl/blob/master/src/symbolic_cliffords.jl">symbolic_cliffords.jl</a> and creating additional right-multiplication special cases &#40;for which <a href="https://github.com/Krastanov/QuantumClifford.jl/commit/d3e84c16b7b08ef6f1bc24e2bcf98641c2fff1ab#r67183201">the Stim library is a good reference</a>&#41;.</p> <p><strong>Recommended skills:</strong> Knowledge of the <a href="https://krastanov.github.io/QuantumClifford.jl/dev/references/">stabilizer formalism</a> used for simulating Clifford circuits.

This project is about making use of improvements in DynamicPPL to create a generic integration between Turing.jl and the AbstractMCMC.jl sampling API. The ultimate goal is to remove or substantially reduce algorithm-specific glue code inside Turing.jl. The project would also involve improving data structures for storing model parameters in DynamicPPL.</p> <h2 id=directed-graphical_model_support_for_the_abstract_probabilistic_programming_library ><a href="#directed-graphical_model_support_for_the_abstract_probabilistic_programming_library">Directed-graphical model support for the abstract probabilistic programming library</a></h2> <p><strong>Mentors</strong>: Philipp Gabler, Hong Ge</p> <p><strong>Project difficulty</strong>: Hard</p> <p><strong>Project length</strong>: 350 hrs</p> <p><strong>Description</strong>: We want to have a very light-weight representation of probabilistic models of static graphs &#40;similar to BUGS&#41;, which can serve as a representation target of other front-end DSLs or be dynamically built. The representation should consist of the model and node representations &#40;stochastic and deterministic, perhaps hyperparameters&#41; and conform to the AbstractPPL model interface, with basic functions &#40;evaluation of density, sampling, conditioning; at later stages some static analysis like extraction of Markov blankets&#41;. The model should also contain the state of the variables and implement the AbstractPPL trace interface &#40;dictionary functions, querying of variable names&#41;. The result should be able to work with existing sampling packages through the abstract interfaces.</p> <h2 id=a_modular_tape_caching_mechanism_for_reversediff ><a href="#a_modular_tape_caching_mechanism_for_reversediff">A modular tape caching mechanism for ReverseDiff</a></h2> <p><strong>Mentors</strong>: Qingliang Zhuo, Mohamed Tarek</p> <p><strong>Project difficulty</strong>: Medium</p> <p><strong>Project length</strong>: 175 hrs</p> <p><strong>Description</strong>: Tape caching often leads to significant performance improvements for gradient-based sampling algorithms &#40;e.g. HMC/NUTS&#41;. Tape caching is only possible at the complete computational level for ReverseDiff at the moment. This project is about implementing a more modular, i.e. function-as-a-caching-barrier, tape caching mechanism for ReverseDiff.jl.</p> <h2 id=benchmarking_improving_performance_of_the_juliagaussianprocesses_libraries ><a href="#benchmarking_improving_performance_of_the_juliagaussianprocesses_libraries">Benchmarking &amp; improving performance of the JuliaGaussianProcesses libraries</a></h2> <p><strong>Mentors</strong>: Theo Galy-Fajou, Will Tebbutt, ST John</p> <p><strong>Project difficulty</strong>: Medium</p> <p><strong>Project length</strong>: 350 hrs</p> <p><strong>Description</strong>: Although KernelFunctions.jl has extensive correctness testing, our performance testing is lacking. This project aims to resolve this, and resolve performance issues wherever they are found. The contributor would first need to extend our existing benchmarking coverage, and debug any obvious performance problems. The next phase of the work would be to construct end-to-end examples of KernelFunctions being used in practice, profile them to determine where performance problems lie, and fix them.</p> <h2 id=iterative_methods_for_inference_in_gaussian_processes ><a href="#iterative_methods_for_inference_in_gaussian_processes">Iterative methods for inference in Gaussian Processes</a></h2> <p><strong>Mentors</strong>: Will Tebbutt, S. T. John, Ross Viljoen</p> <p><strong>Project difficulty</strong>: Medium</p> <p><strong>Project length</strong>: 175 hrs</p> <p><strong>Description</strong>: There has recently been quite a bit of work on inference methods for GPs that use iterative methods rather than the Cholesky factorisation. They look quite promising, but no one has implemented any of these within the Julia GP ecosystem yet, but they should fit nicely within the AbstractGPs framework. If you&#39;re interested in improving the GP ecosystem in Julia, this project might be for you&#33;</p> <h2 id=approximate_inference_methods_for_non-gaussian_likelihoods_in_gaussian_processes ><a href="#approximate_inference_methods_for_non-gaussian_likelihoods_in_gaussian_processes">Approximate inference methods for non-Gaussian likelihoods in Gaussian Processes</a></h2> <p><strong>Mentors</strong>: S. T. John, Ross Viljoen, Theo Galy-Fajou</p> <p><strong>Project difficulty</strong>: Hard</p> <p><strong>Project length</strong>: 350 hrs</p> <p><strong>Description</strong>: Adding <a href="https://github.com/JuliaGaussianProcesses/JuliaGaussianProcesses.github.io/discussions/5#discussioncomment-1627101">approximate inference</a> methods for non-Gaussian likelihoods which are available in other GP packages but not yet within JuliaGPs. The project would start by determining which approximate inference method&#40;s&#41; to implement–-there&#39;s lots to do, and we&#39;re happy to work with a contributor on whichever method they are most interested in, or to suggest one if they have no strong preference.</p> <h2 id=gpu_integration_in_the_juliagps_ecosystem ><a href="#gpu_integration_in_the_juliagps_ecosystem">GPU integration in the JuliaGPs ecosystem</a></h2> <p><strong>Mentors</strong>: Ross Viljoen, Theo Galy-Fajou, Will Tebbutt</p> <p><strong>Project difficulty</strong>: Medium</p> <p><strong>Project length</strong>: 350 hrs</p> <p><strong>Description</strong>: This would involve first ensuring that common models are able to run fully on the GPU, then identifying and improving GPU-specific performance bottlenecks. This would begin by implementing a limited end-to-end example involving a GP with a standard kernel, and profiling it to debug any substantial performance bottlenecks. From there, support for a wider range of the functionality available in KernelFunctions.jl and AbstractGPs.jl can be added. Stretch goal: extension of GPU support to some functionality in ApproximateGPs.jl.</p> <h1 id=vs_code_projects ><a href="#vs_code_projects">VS Code projects</a></h1> <h2 id=vs_code_extension ><a href="#vs_code_extension">VS Code extension</a></h2> <p>We are generally looking for folks that want to help with the <a href="https://www.julia-vscode.org/">Julia VS Code extension</a>. We have a long list of open issues, and some of them amount to significant projects.</p> <p><strong>Required Skills</strong>: TypeScript, julia, web development.</p> <p><strong>Expected Results</strong>: Depends on the specific projects we would agree on.</p> <p><strong>Mentors</strong>: <a href="https://github.com/davidanthoff">David Anthoff</a></p> <h2 id=package_installation_ui ><a href="#package_installation_ui">Package installation UI</a></h2> <p>The VSCode extension for Julia could provide a simple way to browse available packages and view what&#39;s installed on a users system. To start with, this project could simply provide a GUI that reads in package data from a <code>Project.toml</code>/<code>Manifest.toml</code> and show some UI elements to add/remove/manage those packages.</p> <p>This could also be extended by having metadata about the package, such as a readme, github stars, activity and so on &#40;somewhat similar to the VSCode-native extension explorer&#41;.</p> <p><strong>Expected Results</strong>: A UI in VSCode for package operations.</p> <p><strong>Recommended Skills</strong>: Familiarity with TypeScript and Julia development.</p> <p><strong>Mentors</strong>: <a href="https://github.com/pfitzseb">Sebastian Pfitzner</a></p> <p><em>Also take a look at <a href="https://julialang.org/jsoc/gsoc/pluto/">Pluto - VS Code integration</a>&#33;</em></p> <h1 id=web_platform_projects_summer_of_code ><a href="#web_platform_projects_summer_of_code">Web Platform Projects – Summer of Code</a></h1> <p>Julia has early support for targeting WebAssembly and running in the web browser. Please note that this is a rapidly moving area &#40;see the <a href="https://github.com/Keno/julia-wasm">project repository</a> for a more detailed overview&#41;, so if you are interested in this work, please make sure to inform yourself of the current state and talk to us to scope out an appropriate project. The below is intended as a set of possible starting points.</p> <p>Mentor for these projects is <a href="https://github.com/Keno">Keno Fischer</a> unless otherwise stated.</p> <h2 id=code_generation_improvements_and_async_abi ><a href="#code_generation_improvements_and_async_abi">Code generation improvements and async ABI</a></h2> <p>Because Julia relies on an asynchronous task runtime and WebAssembly currently lacks native support for stack management, Julia needs to explicitly manage task stacks in the wasm heap and perform a compiler transformation to use this stack instead of the native WebAssembly stack. The overhead of this transformation directly impacts the performance of Julia on the wasm platform. Additionally, since all code Julia uses &#40;including arbitrary C/C&#43;&#43; libraries&#41; must be compiled using this transformation, it needs to cover a wide variety of inputs and be coordinated with other users having similar needs &#40;e.g. the Pyodide project to run python on the web&#41;. The project would aim to improve the quality, robustness and flexibility of this transformation.</p> <p><strong>Recommended Skills</strong>: Experience with LLVM.</p> <h2 id=wasm_threading ><a href="#wasm_threading">Wasm threading</a></h2> <p>WebAssembly is in the process of standardizing <a href="https://github.com/WebAssembly/threads">threads</a>. Simultaneously, work is ongoing to introduce a new threading runtime in julia &#40;see <a href="https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/pull/22631">#22631</a> and replated PRs&#41;. This project would investigate enabling threading support for Julia on the WebAssembly platform, implementing runtime parallel primitives on the web assembly platform and ensuring that high level threading constructs are correctly mapped to the underlying platform. Please note that both the WebAssembly and julia threading infrastructure is still in active development and may continue to change over the duration of the project. An informed understanding of the state of these projects is a definite prerequisite for this project.</p> <p><strong>Recommended Skills</strong>: Experience with C and multi-threaded programming.</p> <h2 id=high_performance_low-level_integration_of_js_objects ><a href="#high_performance_low-level_integration_of_js_objects">High performance, Low-level integration of js objects</a></h2> <p>WebAssembly is in the process of adding <a href="https://github.com/WebAssembly/reference-types">first class references to native objects</a> to their specification. This capability should allow very high performance integration between julia and javascript objects. Since it is not possible to store references to javascript objects in regular memory, adding this capability will require several changes to the runtime system and code generation &#40;possibly including at the LLVM level&#41; in order to properly track these references and emit them either as direct references to as indirect references to the reference table.</p> <p><strong>Recommended Skills</strong>: Experience with C.</p> <h2 id=dom_integration ><a href="#dom_integration">DOM Integration</a></h2> <p>While julia now runs on the web platform, it is not yet a language that&#39;s suitable for first-class development of web applications. One of the biggest missing features is integration with and abstraction over more complicated javascript objects and APIs, in particular the DOM. Inspiration may be drawn from similar projects in <a href="https://github.com/koute/stdweb">Rust</a> or other languages.</p> <p><strong>Recommended Skills</strong>: Experience with writing libraries in Julia, experience with JavaScript Web APIs.</p> <h2 id=porting_existing_web-integration_packages_to_the_wasm_platform ><a href="#porting_existing_web-integration_packages_to_the_wasm_platform">Porting existing web-integration packages to the wasm platform</a></h2> <p>Several Julia libraries &#40;e.g. WebIO.jl, Escher.jl&#41; provide input and output capabilities for the web platform. Porting these libraries to run directly on the wasm platform would enable a number of existing UIs to automatically work on the web.</p> <p><strong>Recommended Skills</strong>: Experience with writing libraries in Julia.</p> <h2 id=native_dependencies_for_the_web ><a href="#native_dependencies_for_the_web">Native dependencies for the web</a></h2> <p>The Julia project uses <a href="https://github.com/JuliaPackaging/BinaryBuilder.jl">BinaryBuilder</a> to provide binaries of native dependencies of julia packages. Experimental support exists to extend this support to the wasm platform, but few packages have been ported. This project would consist of attempting to port a significant fraction of the binary dependencies of the julia ecosystem to the web platform by improving the toolchain support in BinaryBuilder or &#40;if necessary&#41;, porting upstream packages to fix assumptions not applicable on the wasm platform.</p> <p><strong>Recommended Skills</strong>: Experience with building native libraries in Unix environments.</p> <h2 id=distributed_computing_with_untrusted_parties ><a href="#distributed_computing_with_untrusted_parties">Distributed computing with untrusted parties</a></h2> <p>The Distributed computing abstractions in julia provide convenient abstraction for implementing programs that span many communicating julia processes on different machines. However, the existing abstractions generally assume that all communicating processes are part of the same trust domain &#40;e.g. they allow messages to execute arbitrary code on the remote&#41;. With some of the nodes potentially running in the web browser &#40;or multiple browser nodes being part of the same distributed computing cluster via WebRPC&#41;, this assumption no longer holds true and new interfaces need to be designed to support multiple trust domains without overly restricting usability.</p> <p><strong>Recommended Skills</strong>: Experience with distributed computing and writing libraries in Julia.</p> <h2 id=deployment ><a href="#deployment">Deployment</a></h2> <p>Currently supported use cases for julia on the web platform are primarily geared towards providing interactive environments to support exploration of the full language. Of course, this leads to significantly larger binaries than would be required for using Julia as part of a production deployment. By disabling dynamic language features &#40;e.g. eval&#41; one could generate small binaries suitable for deployment. Some progress towards this exists in packages like <a href="https://github.com/JuliaLang/PackageCompiler.jl">PackageCompiler.jl</a>, though significant work remains to be done.</p> <p><strong>Recommended Skills</strong>: Interest in or experience with Julia internals.</p> </div><br><br> <script src="/previews/PR1680/libs/highlight/highlight.min.js"></script> <script>hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad();hljs.configure({tabReplace: ' '});</script> <footer class="container-fluid footer-copy"> <div class=container > <link href="https://cdn-images.mailchimp.com/embedcode/classic-10_7.css" rel=stylesheet  type="text/css"> <style> #mc_embed_signup{ clear:left; font:14px Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif; } /* Add your own Mailchimp form style overrides in your site stylesheet or in this style block.
